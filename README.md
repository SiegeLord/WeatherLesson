# Weather Lesson

# Plot

The planet of Roneard is having a major heat wave, and the mushrooms are 
catching fire! It is up to you to collect the water from nearby lakes and put 
out the flames before they spread!

# Building instructions

1. Install Allegro 5.
2. Install Rust from rust-lang.org. You'll need the nightly version.
3. Run `cargo run --release` to build and run the game.

On Windows, you can use the pre-built binaries (extracted in the `allegro`
subdirectory). `run_msys.sh` may be useful for this purpose.

# Rules

## Genre requirement

*Theme: water / wet.* The water is used to put out the fires.

## Artistic requirements

*You must integrate subliminal messages into your game.* The title screen 
flashes an encouraging message when navigated away from.

*Have teleporters in your game.* The obelisks teleport you.

## Technical requirement

*Implement and use any image post-processing filter.* When you get close to a 
teleporter, the screen goes all swirly.

## Bonus

Not used.
